# BrandonGiesing.com
The code for the new BrandonGiesing.com powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), [After Dark](https://github.com/comfusion/after-dark), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org)

NOTE: This site isn't a GitHub Page! It's merely using the github.io repo name as a legacy from before I used Netlify. Visit https://brandongiesing.com to see the actual site.
