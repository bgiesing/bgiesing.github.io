      <description>For once, nobody died! I applaud you Camila for holding back this one episode! Then again, it is only Part 1 so if Part 2 has deaths I guess someone did die, in that case, NotLikeThis Camila!

      <description>With the new episode of Glitchtale, Love Part 1, being released today, I realized I completely forgot to do my usual edit for each episode!
So for Do or Die, I decided to change things up slightly with my edit. I really tried to make it faster pace and cram more stuff in to seem more action packed. My other two edits for My Sunshine and Dust were both slower paced.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to this song a lot cause it&amp;rsquo;s so freaking catchy! So I decided to edit some cool fan animations/artwork together. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend too much time so it&amp;rsquo;s not a full blown Fan Music Video but if you guys want it, let me know and maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll extend it later!

      <description>First off, I want to say sorry for the severe lack of videos! I&amp;rsquo;ve either been way to busy or have no ideas when not.
I just recently started getting into this wonderful anime and you should check it out also! Here&amp;rsquo;s an edit of some of the best clips from the show so far set to an instrumental of the show&amp;rsquo;s awesome, jazzy theme song!
Also, since I have been away so long.</description>
