      <description>Welcome to the new BrandonGiesing.com! The &amp;lsquo;Inky Abyss&amp;rsquo; Update Welcome to the brand-new website! Now way faster and simplier than before!
Some things will be a bit rough around the edges while I migrate. If you see any issues, contact me on Twitter.
If you can&amp;rsquo;t find something from the old site, an Outdated copy of old Ghost site is up on GitHub just in case.
Just like last time (The Nepdate), I&amp;rsquo;m continuing the tradition of naming major updates in reference to fandoms (Hyperdimension Neptunia).</description>

      <title>TWiT Schedule Fall 2017: My Thoughts</title>

      <description>Dear TWiT:
If you have seen things I&amp;rsquo;ve shared in the past, you might know that I&amp;rsquo;m obsessed with Technology and been critical of some of the changes you&amp;rsquo;ve made in the past. The past few years have been a bit rocky over there with various controversies, studio changes, show cancelations, etc. For a while, I tuned out of all but one show (All About Android) cause things had gotten to a point where a lot of it was just uninteresting.</description>

      <description>Time for more updates! This one focuses a bit less on the website for once and more on other various projects!
Steem I&amp;rsquo;m now on this blogging platform called Steem which you get paid to post. If that sounds familar, you might remember multiple platforms in the past that promised the same (Tsu, Rabadaba, etc.) but this one is quite a bit different!
Unlike those, Steem is not only a blog but a full blown platform consisting of their own Crypto Currency (think Bitcoin), a blockchain (also like Bitcoin, allows everything to be verifible and distributed), and multiple apps (some official and some unofficial) based on said Blockchain and currency:</description>

      <description>A lot has changed since the last post but a lot of it isn&amp;rsquo;t visible so lets discuss it!
Website Updates New Server As much as I loved using NearlyFreeSpeech, there was some issues with it involving Ghost. Ghost 1.0 just came out and now requires more stuff to install which NearlyFreeSpeech doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow being a shared host.
So to upgrade to Ghost 1.0, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved over to DigitalOcean instead.</description>

      <description>For once, nobody died! I applaud you Camila for holding back this one episode! Then again, it is only Part 1 so if Part 2 has deaths I guess someone did die, in that case, NotLikeThis Camila!

      <description>CosiCast is getting a major overhaul with some HUGE changes!
Redefining Current Shows At the end of last year, I made some changes to CosiCast to divide my content up into Shows based on the content.
These included:
 Shorties: Short random videos covering a range of things from music edits to memes. In 60 Seconds: A topic presented at a fast pace, visual only way! No text or talking, only images, videos, and music!</description>

      <description>Another week and more updates! This week&amp;rsquo;s focus is doing more of various things.
Support Me Page Updated If you love what I do, it would be really nice if you helped me to make more! That&amp;rsquo;s why I have a page with ways you guys can help me continue to do what I do. A lot of the options don&amp;rsquo;t even require you to have to spend money to do it.</description>

      <description>With the new episode of Glitchtale, Love Part 1, being released today, I realized I completely forgot to do my usual edit for each episode!
So for Do or Die, I decided to change things up slightly with my edit. I really tried to make it faster pace and cram more stuff in to seem more action packed. My other two edits for My Sunshine and Dust were both slower paced.</description>

      <description>Another Update so soon! :O Yep, I&amp;rsquo;ve made more changes since the move to the new server so I want to make another Update post!
New Site Features and Improvements I&amp;rsquo;ve added a cool new thing to the site and also made some changes to make it even faster and more secure!
Cosi&amp;rsquo;s Commerce Store Since I talk about a lot of products, I figured I would set up an AStore with Amazon where you can buy some things I like or talk about and support me in the process!</description>

      <title>New Host, Same Site | Updates &amp; Stuff 1</title>

      <description>Welcome to the first of a series of update posts I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing occasionally! This week, the site and email has been migrated to a new host
New Host I&amp;rsquo;ve moved the site off of Ghosted and my Email off of ProtonMail. Now I&amp;rsquo;m using NearlyFreeSpeech and Gmail. Overall this should allow me to provide the same site for way less money and have more control over it.
Why switch?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to this song a lot cause it&amp;rsquo;s so freaking catchy! So I decided to edit some cool fan animations/artwork together. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend too much time so it&amp;rsquo;s not a full blown Fan Music Video but if you guys want it, let me know and maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll extend it later!

      <description>First off, I want to say sorry for the severe lack of videos! I&amp;rsquo;ve either been way to busy or have no ideas when not.
I just recently started getting into this wonderful anime and you should check it out also! Here&amp;rsquo;s an edit of some of the best clips from the show so far set to an instrumental of the show&amp;rsquo;s awesome, jazzy theme song!
Also, since I have been away so long.</description>

      <description>Funny titles aside, welcome to a new year with a new redesign for the site! Keep reading to learn about the changes or skip to the bottom for a tl;dr changelog.
What&amp;rsquo;s New Theme The theme is changed from Caffeine by Kelvin Nguyen to Mapache by GodoFredo. Both themes are good but I liked the more modern style and easier customization of Mapache.
Example: Caffeine required code editing to change Social links and logo while Mapache does it with Ghost&amp;rsquo;s simple Code injection making it easier to update.</description>

      <description>From all the tragedies, YouTube&amp;rsquo;s crap, Trump, and more, this year has been one with many problems&amp;hellip; However, there&amp;rsquo;s been good things also including great new games, Scientific and Medical breakthroughs, and even more.
However, none of the above is the focus right now. Instead let&amp;rsquo;s take a moment to lookback at how I&amp;rsquo;ve improved the video content I make! This is the 2016 Lookback at CosiCast. (formally CosiTube and before that my name)</description>

      <description>So if you know me, I have a &amp;ldquo;habit&amp;rdquo; of constantly moving my site cause &amp;ldquo;reasons&amp;rdquo;. This time, hopefully this will be permanent now that I got great software and money to keep it alive!
Great Software: Ghost In the past I have done many different CMS, Blog, and Static services for my sites. Wordpress, Blogger, Weebly, Webs, and even Tumblr are some of those many.
Another one I used is Jekyll.</description>
