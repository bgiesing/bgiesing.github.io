      <description>Time for more updates! This one focuses a bit less on the website for once and more on other various projects!
Steem I&amp;rsquo;m now on this blogging platform called Steem which you get paid to post. If that sounds familar, you might remember multiple platforms in the past that promised the same (Tsu, Rabadaba, etc.) but this one is quite a bit different!
Unlike those, Steem is not only a blog but a full blown platform consisting of their own Crypto Currency (think Bitcoin), a blockchain (also like Bitcoin, allows everything to be verifible and distributed), and multiple apps (some official and some unofficial) based on said Blockchain and currency:</description>

      <description>For once, nobody died! I applaud you Camila for holding back this one episode! Then again, it is only Part 1 so if Part 2 has deaths I guess someone did die, in that case, NotLikeThis Camila!

      <description>CosiCast is getting a major overhaul with some HUGE changes!
Redefining Current Shows At the end of last year, I made some changes to CosiCast to divide my content up into Shows based on the content.
These included:
 Shorties: Short random videos covering a range of things from music edits to memes. In 60 Seconds: A topic presented at a fast pace, visual only way! No text or talking, only images, videos, and music!</description>

      <title>Ready, Set, DIE! | Glitchtale Season 2</title>

      <description>With the new episode of Glitchtale, Love Part 1, being released today, I realized I completely forgot to do my usual edit for each episode!
So for Do or Die, I decided to change things up slightly with my edit. I really tried to make it faster pace and cram more stuff in to seem more action packed. My other two edits for My Sunshine and Dust were both slower paced.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to this song a lot cause it&amp;rsquo;s so freaking catchy! So I decided to edit some cool fan animations/artwork together. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend too much time so it&amp;rsquo;s not a full blown Fan Music Video but if you guys want it, let me know and maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll extend it later!

      <description>First off, I want to say sorry for the severe lack of videos! I&amp;rsquo;ve either been way to busy or have no ideas when not.
I just recently started getting into this wonderful anime and you should check it out also! Here&amp;rsquo;s an edit of some of the best clips from the show so far set to an instrumental of the show&amp;rsquo;s awesome, jazzy theme song!
Also, since I have been away so long.</description>

      <description>From all the tragedies, YouTube&amp;rsquo;s crap, Trump, and more, this year has been one with many problems&amp;hellip; However, there&amp;rsquo;s been good things also including great new games, Scientific and Medical breakthroughs, and even more.
However, none of the above is the focus right now. Instead let&amp;rsquo;s take a moment to lookback at how I&amp;rsquo;ve improved the video content I make! This is the 2016 Lookback at CosiCast. (formally CosiTube and before that my name)</description>
