      <description>Time for more updates! This one focuses a bit less on the website for once and more on other various projects!
Steem I&amp;rsquo;m now on this blogging platform called Steem which you get paid to post. If that sounds familar, you might remember multiple platforms in the past that promised the same (Tsu, Rabadaba, etc.) but this one is quite a bit different!
Unlike those, Steem is not only a blog but a full blown platform consisting of their own Crypto Currency (think Bitcoin), a blockchain (also like Bitcoin, allows everything to be verifible and distributed), and multiple apps (some official and some unofficial) based on said Blockchain and currency:</description>

      <description>A lot has changed since the last post but a lot of it isn&amp;rsquo;t visible so lets discuss it!
Website Updates New Server As much as I loved using NearlyFreeSpeech, there was some issues with it involving Ghost. Ghost 1.0 just came out and now requires more stuff to install which NearlyFreeSpeech doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow being a shared host.
So to upgrade to Ghost 1.0, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved over to DigitalOcean instead.</description>

      <description>CosiCast is getting a major overhaul with some HUGE changes!
Redefining Current Shows At the end of last year, I made some changes to CosiCast to divide my content up into Shows based on the content.
These included:
 Shorties: Short random videos covering a range of things from music edits to memes. In 60 Seconds: A topic presented at a fast pace, visual only way! No text or talking, only images, videos, and music!</description>

      <description>Another week and more updates! This week&amp;rsquo;s focus is doing more of various things.
Support Me Page Updated If you love what I do, it would be really nice if you helped me to make more! That&amp;rsquo;s why I have a page with ways you guys can help me continue to do what I do. A lot of the options don&amp;rsquo;t even require you to have to spend money to do it.</description>

      <description>Another Update so soon! :O Yep, I&amp;rsquo;ve made more changes since the move to the new server so I want to make another Update post!
New Site Features and Improvements I&amp;rsquo;ve added a cool new thing to the site and also made some changes to make it even faster and more secure!
Cosi&amp;rsquo;s Commerce Store Since I talk about a lot of products, I figured I would set up an AStore with Amazon where you can buy some things I like or talk about and support me in the process!</description>

      <title>New Host, Same Site | Updates &amp; Stuff 1</title>

      <description>Welcome to the first of a series of update posts I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing occasionally! This week, the site and email has been migrated to a new host
New Host I&amp;rsquo;ve moved the site off of Ghosted and my Email off of ProtonMail. Now I&amp;rsquo;m using NearlyFreeSpeech and Gmail. Overall this should allow me to provide the same site for way less money and have more control over it.
Why switch?</description>
