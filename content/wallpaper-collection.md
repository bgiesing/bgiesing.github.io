# About
## The Wallpapers
There are 9 total wallpapers available divided into 4 groups:

- Basic Collection: Canonical Pixels, Rainbow Burst and Project Falls
- Material Collection: Based on colors from the Material Design palette and emulate real-life Materials. Includes Material Shards and Material Fuzz.
- Check It Collection: Based on Cartoon Network's Check It colors. Includes Check It Material and Check It Glass (Glass is what I use for CosiCast as the outro and branding!)
- Nextbit Collection: Based on the colors of the Nextbit Robin. Includes the winning #Robinwall Contest entry, Fiery Nights, and a remixed version called Vivid Nights.

<p class="note">Sometimes I'll add new wallpapers to the collection! If you previously bought it, let me know your order number and I'll see if you are eligible to get the new additions for no extra cost!</p>

## The Charities
I'll donate 50% of all sales (after processing fees) to the EFF and Wikipedia Foundation (half to each). I'll be doing this once a month or so depending on how big each purchase is (cause I have to do it manually and smaller purchases are harder to divide to donate) and then post proofs here so you guys know I'm actually doing it.

### EFF
Whether it be dealing with fair use on YouTube to providing tools to make your browsing secure and private, the  Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) helps to protect your rights in this digital age.

### Wikimedia
The Wikimedia Foundation runs one of the most popular and free information sources on the internet, Wikipedia, and aims to provide the public with easy and free access to knowledge.
