title: "Get some of my best Wallpapers and help support Charity!"

Want a new look for your device? Get some of my best original Wallpapers and
help support charity in the process!

If you use Gumroad, you can pay what you want and I'll donate 50% of the
proceeds from this Collection to the EFF and Wikimedia Foundation to help keep
the internet a great and informative place! If you use Coinbase, it's a set
price of $1 in Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum. Due to how it
works, I can't donate the 50% to charity and I can't make it pay-what-you-want
so I would prefer you use Gumroad but I understand some people might want to use
Crypto for various reasons. You will have to provide Name and email so I can
send you the files.

## About

### The Wallpapers

There are 9 total wallpapers available divided into 4 groups:

- Basic Collection: Canonical Pixels, Rainbow Burst and Project Falls
- Material Collection: Based on colors from the Material Design palette and
  emulate real-life Materials. Includes Material Shards and Material Fuzz.
- Check It Collection: Based on Cartoon Network's Check It colors. Includes
  Check It Material and Check It Glass (Glass is what I use for CosiCast as the
  outro and branding!)
- Nextbit Collection: Based on the colors of the Nextbit Robin. Includes the
  winning #Robinwall Contest entry, Fiery Nights, and a remixed version called
  Vivid Nights.

> Sometimes I'll add new wallpapers to the collection! If you previously bought
> it, let me know your order number and I'll see if you are eligible to get the
> new additions for no extra cost!

### The Charities

I'll donate 50% of all Gumroad sales (after processing fees) to the EFF and
Wikipedia Foundation (half to each). I'll be doing this once a month or so
depending on how big each purchase is (cause I have to do it manually and
smaller purchases are harder to divide to donate) and then post proofs here so
you guys know I'm actually doing it.

#### EFF

Whether it be dealing with fair use on YouTube to providing tools to make your
browsing secure and private, the  Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) helps to
protect your rights in this digital age.

#### Wikimedia

The Wikimedia Foundation runs one of the most popular and free information
sources on the internet, Wikipedia, and aims to provide the public with easy and
free access to knowledge.
