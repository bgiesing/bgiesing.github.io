title: "Ways To Support Me"
---

If you like the various projects I do (or have done in the past), a donation
would be appreciated!

## No money? No problem

Do you want to help me but have nothing yourself? Fear not, you still can!

### Money Routine

One of the easiest ways is to signup for the "beermoney" services using the
referral links on [my Money Making Routine page](/money/) and I'll make a bit of
money while you make money. A Win-Win for both of us!

### CosiMine

If you are willing to let a webpage stay open and use a small portion of your
CPU usage, you can run [CosiMine](/cosimine/) which mines cryptocurrency with
your browser.

### Other Ways

- Share my content!
  - More people who see it, the more likely somebody who can donate will see it
    or more ad revenue from more people.
- Critiques/Constructive Criticism
  - Tell me honestly what you think of my work (without being hateful) and I can
    take that advice to improve my content (leading to more viewers)

## Donations

### Cash

You can pay me with good old fashioned cash at [my PayPal.me
page](https://paypal.me/bgiesing) or with Dwolla by sending it to
<me@brandongiesing.com>.

You can also use [StreamElements](https://streamelements.com/brandongiesing/tip)
if you want an alert to appear while I'm livestreaming.

### Monthly contributions

If you want to support me on an on-going basis, there's two separate ways you
can do it:

- [Patreon](https://patreon.com/BrandonGiesing)
- [GameWisp](http://gamewisp.com/channel/brandongiesing)

Both get you extra benefits at various tiers based on how much you choose to
give:

- Exclusive Updates and Behind the scenes posts
- Early Access to new Videos
- Extra Cast Cash to use on my Twitch stream for song requests and more
- 1 free priority song bump a week.
- Custom art like Wallpapers
- Vote on Video ideas

### Cryptocoins

If you use Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies, click the "Pay with ShapeShift"
or "Donate with Coinbase Commerce" button below to send your coin to me.

## Buying Stuff

You can also buy stuff from or for me!

### Amazon

You can buy stuff for me as a gift from my [Amazon
Wishlist](http://a.co/24eU8Dn).

### [Wallpaper Collection](/wallpaper-collection/)

You can buy my Wallpaper Collection to get some cool wallpapers I designed and
support both me and charity in the process! 50% of all Gumroad proceeds go to
either the EFF or Wikimedia Foundation.

### Art Commissions

I can also do some Graphic Design work (mostly Wallpapers but Logos also)!

Just contact me at <me@brandongiesing.com> or on my
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/BrandonGiesing) for more details.

### Other Stuff

- My (shitty) Remixes on [Bandcamp](https://bgiesing.bandcamp.com)
- Clothing, Stickers, and other merch products on
  [Redbubble](http://redbubble.com/people/bgiesing)
