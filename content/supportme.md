title: "Ways To Support Me"
---

If you like the various projects I do (or have done in the past), a donation would be appreciated!

# No money? No problem!
Do you want to help me but have nothing yourself? Fear not, you still can!

## Money Routine
One of the easiest ways is to signup for the "beermoney" services using the referral links on [my Money Making Routine page](/money/) and I'll make a bit of money while you make money. A Win-Win for both of us!

## CosiMine
If you are willing to let a webpage stay open and use a small portion of your CPU usage, you can run [CosiMine](/cosimine/) which mines cryptocurrency with your browser.

## Other Ways

- Share my content!
  - More people who see it, the more likely somebody who can donate will see it or more ad revenue from more people.
- Critiques/Constructive Criticism
  - Tell me honestly what you think of my work (without being hateful) and I can take that advice to improve my content (leading to more viewers)

# Donations
## Cash
You can pay me with good old fashioned cash at <a class="external" href="https://paypal.me/bgiesing" >my PayPal.me page</a> or with Dwolla by sending it to <me@brandongiesing.com>.

## Cryptocoins
If you use Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies, click the "Pay with ShapeShift" or "Donate with Coinbase Commerce" button below to send your coin to me.

# Buying Stuff
You can also buy stuff from or for me!

## Amazon
You can buy stuff for me as a gift from my <a class="external" href="http://a.co/24eU8Dn">Amazon Wishlist</a>.

## [Wallpaper Collection](/wallpaper-collection/)
You can buy my Wallpaper Collection to get some cool wallpapers I designed and support both me and charity in the process! 50% of all Gumroad proceeds go to either the EFF or Wikimedia Foundation.

## Art Commissions
I can also do some Graphic Design work (mostly Wallpapers but Logos also)!

Just contact me at <me@brandongiesing.com> or on my <a class="external" href="https://twitter.com/BrandonGiesing">Twitter</a> for more details.

## Other Stuff
- My (shitty) Remixes on <a class="external" href="https://bgiesing.bandcamp.com" >Bandcamp</a>
