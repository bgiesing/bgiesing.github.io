## Personal Projects
### Pravox Networks (DISC)
![Pravox Logo](/content/images/2017/01/pravox-networks.png)
A very passionate project of mine whose goal was to make linear TV-like stations for online content.

It was similar to Pluto.tv with a few differences:

  - User submissions for the content
  - User voting on the current video (to skip or keep)
  - Live chat

Ultimately, shut down because almost nobody ever watched and the few who didn't want to contribute making it impossible to continue.

### Vox Variety (DISC)
![Vox Variety Logo](https://www.sideprojectors.com/img/projects/3539-0-original.jpg)
Before Pravox Networks, Vox Variety tried to be an internet radio station mixing popular music with small indie artists who can't get on radio. 

Shutdown because Radionomy (the hoster) got sued and shut it down.

### Famigo/Voxive Android Tools (DISC)
A set of tools for Android devices that I released over the years, all are currently discontinued.

All (unless stated) were called Famigo and later rebranded Voxive before shutting down.

#### Remover
Based on PA GApps remover by TKRuzze, it added:

- Stock bloatware removal options (GApps Remover only did GApps)
- AROMA Interface (for on the fly config)
- One zip for multiple OSes (GApps Remover had one for each)

#### GApps
A GApps package based on PA GApps that added:

- Integrated Remover
- AROMA (for on-the-fly config)

Discontinued with some functionality merged into Open GApps' AROMA package.

#### Famigo and Vox ROMs
Two different ROMs here:

- Famigo (for Nexus 7 (2012))
  - Modded from PACman (aka not compiled from source)
  - Removed as much as possible to make it barebones
  - Extra Apps package that allowed you to add back some of the removed software or choose a replacement (Example: Add back AOSP Browser or replace with Chrome)
- Vox (for Nexus 7 (2013) and Nexus 5)
  - Based on AOSPA Source with a few patches added that didn't get merged into upstream
     - Qualcomm QuickBoot support
     - USB-OTG support
     - Tablet Multi-user support for PA features
     - Swipe on notifications to open Floating mode
     - Custom MMS app from Reinvented ROM
     - Reordered Settings
   - Also removed some apps.

Famigo was discontinued because it was a crappy mod not based on source while Vox was discontinued as most of the patches got merged in or dropped by AOSPA themselves and Vox Remover could do the other half.

### Small Random Code Things
- [Grunify (HIA)](https://github.com/bgiesing/grun): Chrome Extension to change every word to Grun (made for Spagoots and based on Hodorify extension by Steven Dunn)
- [.vimrc (HIA)](https://github.com/bgiesing/vimrc): My VIM config file forked from amix's ultimate vimrc and including some keybindings for tips from VimCasts.

### Playboard Channels (HIA)
I was frustrated with trying find to certain types of new and interesting Android apps (Keyboards, Launchers, etc) because the Play Store was cluttered with a boatload of themes (mostly from Go apps) so you couldn't really find actual apps, just themes for one of those apps.

I made these Playboard channels to share ones I found to make it easier for others. I don't actively update it much anymore but I may come back eventually.

## Contributed Projects
### Open GApps (NAC)
![Open GApps Banner](/content/images/2017/01/roundedbanner.png)

My biggest contribution was porting the site to Jekyll and adding a blog. Also updated app sources, fixed some bugs (mostly with the AROMA package), and helped start the Android TV Stock package.

After a dispute, I left the team but have no grudges against them and I still use it personally.
