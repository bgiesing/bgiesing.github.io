# Apps
## Passive Apps
- AppTrailers
    * Run the apps section until values reduce to 0 points
    * Do the free daily scratcher
    * Convert to Perk Points in the Redeem tab.
- Perk TV
    * Run passively 24/7
    * App Trailers, Perk Productions, or Netflix Trailers playlist are best
    * Enable "Low Resolution Video" in the navigation drawer/hamburger
   menu/sidebar.
- Perk Pop Quiz
    * Enable "Lightning Mode" in the navigation drawer/hamburger menu/sidebar.
    * Do Daily Quiz and try to answer as good as possible
    * The rest of time, don't touch the device while a quiz runs. Lighting Mode

- Viggle or Perk TV Live
    * Check in when you watch TV
    * Do Viggle's Quizzes during commercial break.
    * Post on Twitter through PTV Live to get points.

## Other Apps
- Unlock & Win
    * Lockscreen with random chance for tokens or points
    * Do the occasional videos inside the app.

# Web
- Perk.com Bonus Video
    * Go to Perk.com's [Bonus Video page](http://perk.com/bonus/video) and play
anything there. A lot of the times it will play 5-15 times and each one is
usually 11 points.
- Perk.tv/Viggle.tv
    * Choose Low Quality mode under the menu (click your avatar)

## [EngageMe.TV](http://EngageMe.TV)
Just like InstaGC and Swagbucks, you can do any of the EngageMe.TV
offers under the Adscend Media Offer Wall. (otherwise
known as AdWall) Go to Perk's site and find Adscend Media
under Complete Offers

The Flash powered ones like App Trailers are more resource intensive but do get
you more ads so try to run them if possible. If you can't, the HTML5 ones like
How-To and Gaming work also.

## Search
Like other sites, you can use Perk as your search engine but unlike the others
who only every so many searches you get points, you will always get points
(between 2-20 usually) with Perk's Yahoo search.

# Perk Codes
Perk Codes are shared on their social media and are usually about 10-50 points.

 * If enough people use it, everybody will also get an additional bonus amount
   so if you know somebody who also uses Perk, make sure to share it with them.
 * Expires after a few hours.

http://sbcodez.com  (who also does the SB codes) posts them as soon as they come
out in their chat box and on a 2nd Twitter account. (which you can use to get
SMS/Push notifications)
