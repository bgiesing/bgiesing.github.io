To earn like this, you are gonna need devices to earn a decent amount. You can
start with either old ones you have laying around or buy really inexpensive
options. This page contains some tips on choosing devices and what I use myself.

## Buying Devices

When buying dedicated money devices, don't just go straight for the most
inexpensive ones! Yes they may be very low priced and easier to make a return of
investment (ROI) on but they will likely need to be replaced more often and you
would have saved in the long run by spending a tiny bit more.

A good example here is the LG Lucky/Sunrise ($10) vs the Optimus Zone 3/Rebel
LTE ($20). Both can run most apps fine but the first one has had many "bricking"
issues for money makers.

> Bricking is when a device becomes completely unusable (won't turn on or
> connect to internet) essentially making it a "brick" on your desk.

Make sure you also don't spend too much however otherwise you'll lose money
instead of make it. When beginning, $30 should be the max and then later on, you
can buy some slightly more expensive devices up to about $50. One exception to
the rule is iOS devices which will cost more being Apple. Ideally spend between
$50-120 for these tops if you do need one eventually.

## What I Use

I currently use 8 dedicated mobile devices and 3 dedicated PCs plus occasionally
my main phone, Android TV, and PC for money making. [You can visit the store to
buy these from Amazon while also supporting
me!](https://brandongiesing.com/store)

> Primary App is the app I run first (usually apps that require more interaction
> like AppTrailers) while Secondary App(s) are ran after that's completed and
> are the more passive app requiring less interaction.

### Accessories

- UNITEK 10-port Charging Station
  - Charges your devices
  - Also a nice stand to keep them tidy.
- 7 ANKER PowerLine+ Micro USB/Lightning Cables
  - The cheaper PowerLine ones (instead of "PowerLine+") should work also but
    won't last as long due to the PowerLine+ version having a braided cable.
  - Not necessary but definitely helps to reduce cable clutter.
- Google OnHub by ASUS
  - If you want to buy one, I recommend the newer version called Google Wifi
    instead. Slightly cheaper, better speeds, and you can combine multiple to
    increase house coverage.
- Seagate Slim and a cheap External HDD Enclosure
  - Two external hard drives used with Storj Share alongside some of my
    computer's internal storage
  - 50% of the capacity of the Seagate's 500 GB drive (rest is my backups)
  - 100% of the 250 GB drive I put in the enclosure
