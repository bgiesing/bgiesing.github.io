The following is a list of apps/sites I use or have used in the past divided into sections of what type of stuff you do to earn. Each one includes some basic info and tips plus some even have dedicated pages full of tips for them.

> If they are linked or include a code, it's my referral link! Plus, they are shortened with Shorte.st which shows an ad redirect. So if they don't have a link or you don't want to use my referrals/paid links, just search for them with your favorite search engine instead.

# Current
#### Variety
To qualify as a "Variety" site/app, these ones have to include any combination of Videos, OfferWalls, Surveys, Search, Downloads, etc and some of the features have to be made by themselves, not a third-party (like EngageMe for instance for videos). These usually pay big cause the vast amount of stuff you can do and the unique exclusive features.

- [InstaGC (Web)](https://www.instagc.com/bgiesing)
  - Instant cashouts, great if you need to quickly get an extra dollar or so.

  - Daily codes on Earnably's social media and some Beermoney sites have bonus codes (TheTechSlug's Facebook Group, BrokeStudentSupply, etc.)
  - Offerwalls, Surveys, EngageMe, VideoLab, VideoLoyalty, and more.

#### Offerwalls
These sites/apps are mostly a "wrapper" around offerwalls and 3rd-party video providers like EngageMe, VideoLab, and VideoLoyalty with nothing provided by themselves. Not the fastest earners but if you are a busy person, most of these run with 24/7 with very little intervention!

- [Earn.gg (Web)](https://earn.gg?ref=bgiesing)
  - EngageMe, VideoLab, Offer Walls, and Daily Bonus

  - Mostly Gaming focused so has a lot of Steam games for discounts but also has Amazon Gift Cards.

#### Videos
These apps play videos 24/7 with little to no intervention. Unlike the Offerwall and Variety categories above, these ones use videos by themselves and not a third-party provider and also it's the only thing they do.

- [KoinMe (Web)](http://koinme.com/af-hpY89xFa1e)

  - Watch the any of the playlists 24/7
     - Top Trending GIF or Streaming Sketches are my usual ones.

#### Social Networking
These sites/apps aren't going to be fast earners but if you make stuff online (like videos or art), you are already going to promote it so might as well earn a few cents from it.

- Steem (Web)
  - Cryptocurrency/Blockchain powered platform (Social Network, Video Host, Blog, etc.)

  - Also allows photo posts like Flii.by

#### Panels
These sites/apps run 99.9999% passive and pay you for your data. One of the slowest but most consistent and least effort earners. However if you don't want to sell your data even for a reward, avoid these.

  - $3 Prepaid VISA for sending them your Amazon history once a month.

#### Faucets
Faucets are sites that pay you for completing a captcha every so many minutes or hours. Most of them pay in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies which means the amount you earn can change value at any moment so keep a track on BTC prices and withdraw as soon as price drops significantly to minimize loss.

<p class="warning">These won't be included in the earnings below because of Bitcoin's constant price changes.</p>

- [FreeBitco.in (Web)](http://freebitco.in/?r=1974584)
  - Fill out the CAPATCHA and claim once an hour.

  - Disable Automatic Withdrawals and use their Earn tab to earn interest. The amount of interest you earn each day will grow as you continue to claim.
     - TIP: Use the Deposit feature to get a BTC wallet address and use that address for all the below sites to combine all the BTC withdrawals into FreeBitco.in and earn intrest!
- BitMaker by CakeCodes (Apps) [Use Code: `RDEEVG` for Referral]
  - Claim 500 Blocks every 30 Mins

#### Tasks/Surveys
These sites/apps require more effort but (usually) pay high amounts each day by doing small manual labor like Surveys, translations, transcriptions, recording audio/video, and more.

- Amazon Mechanical Turk [MTurk] (Web)
   - The best survey/task site!
   - Pays to Amazon GC or Amazon Payments (which can be exported to your bank)

#### Link Shortners/Ad Monetization
These sites/apps allow you to earn ad revenue either by actual ads on your site or a "redirect" page with an ad on a shortened link. Can be effective if you have lots of people viewing your content that will click links but be warned as a lot of them have some bad ads that can give viruses so choose carefully.

## Former
These ones I used to do but stopped because I either couldn't get them to work at all, they take way too long to do, or are scams you should avoid.

#### Videos
- [InboxDollars (Web+Apps)](http://inboxdollars.com/?r=bgiesing)
  - Confirm all PaidEmails (2 cents each)
  - Do InboxDollars TV (I do the Tech channel as it's short videos)
  - Do the 50 daily videos in the video section (not TV, confusing right?)
  - Sweeps entries are a separate point system so enter them as you won't lose any of your earnings.

#### Social Networking
- [Rabadaba (Web+Apps)](http://www.rabadaba.com/welcome/bgiesing)
  - Changed into a pet-focused site, not bad if you want that but I personally used it for promoting art/videos so it's not useful for me specifically anymore.
  - Post as much as you can! More posts equals more points!
  - Don't spam or use content you don't own! One it's against the rules and second, people are more likely to vote for good content.
  - Up/Down vote as many posts as you can a day. Try to hit the limit.
  - Redab/Repost other's works.
  - Make a hashtag to categorize your posts! It's easier for people to vote on your stuff if they can find it (since Rabadaba doesn't let people filter redabs out of your profile.

#### Tasks/Surveys
- Surveys on the GO (Apps)
  - Do the quick surveys.

#### Others
- [FeaturePoints (Apps)](http://featu.re/RP46ZM)
  - Download apps to make money
  - Awesome referral program where you get 50% of what your friends get for life!

# Passive Interest
Once you've earned money via the above sites, you should put some of it into these sites to earn interest on them if you aren't actively using it all.

#### Savings Accounts
Savings accounts earn slowly but are very stable and consistent. There's two main types, "normal" which allows up to 6 withdrawals per month in case you really need the cash and CD (aka Certificate of Deposit) which has no withdrawals unless you pay a massive penalty but usually has higher rates for more earnings.

I use Ally Bank as their normal Savings accounts has one of the highest rates at 1.15% APY (most are under 1%, usually like 0.01% so it's massively better).

For Bitcoin, you can use FreeBitco.in as mentioned above.

#### Stocks
<p class="warning">Stocks are very volatile! Don't go crazy and lose everything!</p>

- [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/referral/brandog408/)
  - Free (as in no fees, not no money entirely) to do stock market trading
  - By joining with someone's Referral (mine above), you will get a completely free share (so both no fees and no money from you) on join and a free share for anyone who signs up under you! So if you want to try stocks with basically no risk as it's all profit, this is a great way to do it.
