InstaGC is a great site for a few simple reasons:

1. They have a supportive staff! Most websites don't seem to care about users at
   all but InstaGC works really hard to make sure users get the best they can.
2. It's in their name! Insta aka Instant! Almost everything on their site pays
   out instantly and you can cash out for many gift cards or PayPal instantly.
3. Almost everything (including videos) is HTML5/Mobile compatible so there's
   not as many earning problems from Flash.

## Videos

### VideoLab

Currently the best passive earner on InstaGC! Runs with no interaction for days
as long as it's not glitching out like it does sometimes. It will auto-reload
when there's new ads to play.

Find it on the OfferToro offer wall.

### InstaGC Watch

- Works and runs best on Mobile devices
  - I do playlist 1 and 2 on my Xiaomi MiBox Android TV with Chrome sideloaded
    and a Bluetooth mouse to control.
- No Flash
- 3 playlists at the same time to earn 3x faster
  - Ideally spread it out across 2-3 devices instead of all on one to reduce the
    chance of crashes.
- Weekly Bonus based on how many videos you watch and the "quality".
  - "Quality" includes things like users muting videos for example and it's
    based on every user combined, not just you.

### hyperMX, AdBistro, and Volume11 videos

These are very quick 1 point offers. Just check back every hour or so to see if
they refilled.

Volume11 is currently not available but if it ever returns, the same should
apply

- AdBistro
  - Only has the timer window that the other two have but it's more consistent
    with times. The other two can be anywhere from 5 pages with 30 seconds wait
    for each to 20 pages with a 1 minute wait. AdBistro is almost always 3 pages
    with a 30 second wait.
  - For me at least, has more inventory than hyperMX making it appear more
    often.
- hyperMX/Volume11
  - Both of these involve either watching a full video or opening a window that
    requires you to hit "Next" once a timer ends.

## Point Booster Codes

Like other sites, InstaGC also has codes but it works a bit differently.

There's 3 types of codes:

- Staff-provided
  - Almost everyday, InstaGC will post a code on their Social Media that anybody
    can enter for so many points
  - These aren't time-limited by an hour. They are usually available until the
    next day when they post a new code.
  - [SBCodez](https://sbcodez.com) (who also does the SB codes) posts them as
    soon as they come out in their chat box and on a 2nd Twitter account (which
    you can use to get SMS/Push notifications.)
- Chat codes
  - Once you hit $50 redeemed, you get access to the chat. Every hour or so a
    random code is posted.
  - Only so many people can use these codes so you have to be fast.
  - Having the code page open at all times to quickly switch to and enter the
    code makes this easier.
- User-provided
  - Users can redeem their earnings to be generous and give other people points.
  - You choose the name which will always be prefixed with "IGC-" (For example,
    `IGC-XXXXXXXX`) and how many points and users can use it
    - For instance, if you make the code for 10 users to get 10 points each, you
      would redeem 100 points to make the code.
  - These are occasionally posted in the chat and in comments on their Facebook
    page so keep an eye out for them.

## Other Tips

- Check the Ticker on the right of the page on Desktop or by clicking Ticker on
  the sidebar on mobile. This shows what offers people are getting points from
  in realtime. If you suddenly see 200+ people do an offer, it's probably really
  easy to get credit from.
- Similarly, check the chat! Often users will post quick and easy surveys or
  offers they found.
- You can use InstaGC as your search engine to have a chance to get some points
  on your normal searches.
