This page shows what I've made from what I described on the past few pages. As I
said on the 1st page disclaimer, your results may vary tons so don't blame me if
you don't earn as much.

> All earnings are my own on most sites. The only sites I have active referrals
> on currently are InstaGC, Swagbucks, and FreeBitcoin

## 2018 Earnings

> Like last year, I'm continuing to use a spreadsheet to auto-update earnings
> here. This year I added the Summary tab (which also shows expense categories)
> to the public embed. I'm still keeping the specific expenses private however.

## 2017 Earnings

> Starting April 2017, I'm now tracking earnings each month instead of All-Time
> like I was doing. I went back to get 99.99% of earnings from January to now
> before I started tracking but it might be slightly inaccurate for earnings
> before then cause I might have missed stuff.
>
> Since it's updated live from a Google Sheet I use to track Income and
> Expenses, it also contains any Income I receive including non-Beermoney
> earnings. 99% of Earnings are from Beermoney however.
