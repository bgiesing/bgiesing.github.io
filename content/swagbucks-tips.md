[Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/BrandonGiesing) is one of the best earners as they give large amounts and have many
things you can do to earn those points (called Swagbucks/SBs). Here's a few tips
for how to maximize your earnings without doing tons of surveys you won't
qualify for and with any purchasing optional!

# Passive Video Apps
Swagbucks has many mobile apps on both iOS and Android. They are some of the
best ways to earn and each app is just videos that you can continuously play in
the background on mute!

 * Run all of them! There's 6 apps (SB TV/Watch, Lifestylez, Sportly,
   EntertaiNow, IndyMusic, and MovieClips) and each of them has about 5 rounds
   that give you 1-4 SB each and the cap resets 3 times a day (Midnight, 2pm,
   and 6pm PST) That's 90-360 SB/day (32,400-129,600 SB/year) if you do all 6
   apps. This isn't even accounting for bonus rounds so some days can be way
   better.
 * Use Android for all the apps. The Android versions allow you to Find the
   shortest possible video and favorite it (long press and tap "Add to
   Favorites") and it will loop it over and over. Since the shortest videos on
   each app range from 8 seconds to 30 seconds, you will bust through all the
   apps in no time and get the maximum earnings.
 * Do multiple apps at once! If you have more than one mobile device, run as
   many of the apps at once as you can! Just make sure you don't run the same
   app at the same time as they could detect that and ban you, so only 1 of each
   of the 6 apps at a time but all 6 can be run together.
 * Sometimes they release updates that don't work so well. You can work around
   this on Android by uninstalling the app, downloading and installing the old
   APK (APKPure is a good, safe source), and making sure to disable auto-update
   in the Play Store. iOS can't be downgraded.

# Web
## Daily Quick Tasks
 * Daily Poll: Answer a question, 1 SB/day, 365 SB/year
 * Deal of the Day: Simply click it under the To-Do list, don't actually have to
   do the deal itself. 1 SB/day, 365 SB/year
 * Inbox: Check It, often contains simple ways to earn more! "Watch and Earn" is
   one of the best but there's also more.
 * Daily Goal: Check to see what your 2 goals are and complete at least the
   first one. You will get anywhere from 300-1000 SB/month extra
 * Search: Do a few searches a day, you may get some SBs on them.

## [EngageMe.TV](http://EngageMe.TV)
Under the Adscend Media Offer Wall (otherwise known as AdWall), do any of the 
EngageMe.TV offers. These are on other sites also so just pick which one you want.

Having Flash enabled will get you more ads but is also more resource intensive.
You can run 3 channels at a time on 3 separate devices (3 tabs/windows on same
device WILL get you banned)

## SwagButton Watch / ToolbarTV
The SwagButton (their Chrome/Firefox addon) has a section called Watch which
pays 3SB for about 20-50 videos.

 * Some playlists work better than others, test them out as they change often.
 * You can do multiple of them at the same time on different computers. I've
   only tested 2 at once to be on the safe side.
 * Use the ToolbarTV link instead of the addon! The SwagButton Watch section
   actually pulls up this URL (http://toolbartv.swagbucks.com). Using that URL
   is preferred as you don't need the extension installed (which can slow your
   machine down badly) and if you're using Chrome/Firefox, you can mute tabs
   (right click on the tab > Mute Tab) but not pop-ups so this allows you to
   mute it without muting your whole computer.

## nCraves
Swagbucks has a section called nCraves which some autoplay. These are great if
you are going to walk away for a while.

 * Use the Flashcontrol extension to prevent Flash from loading as your computer
   can get really bad with the Flash enabled OR disable Flash completely by
   going to chrome://plugins on Chrome-based browsers (Chrome, Chromium, Opera,
   Vivaldi, etc., not sure about Firefox or other browsers)
    * On any newer
      Chrome version (v55+) and Microsoft Edge, Flash is now auto-blocked for
      all sites by default so you don't have to worry about this. If you use a
      Chrome-based browser or non-Chrome-based browser like Firefox that doesn't
      do it yet, the above still applies.
 * Only do the ones with the Auto symbol on them (the blue circles with circle
   arrow or play button inside)
 * Higher Value ones will take longer (good if you need to leave) but smaller
   value ones will ultimately earn you more.
 * If you see a Happy Hour  nCrave, do it! They are high value ones but with
   shorter time lengths!

The best playlists right now are the "All-you-can-eat" ones (Two ones called
that and one called nCrave TV) It requires almost no interaction and most days
it's stable enough to run the whole day without needing to check on it for
around 12-16 SB/hour.

## Swago, Spin & Win, and Team Challenges
These are three things Swagbucks does occasionally to make easy SB based on
stuff you already do.

 * Swago
    * Complete as much of a bingo board by clicking the squares to do
      stuff.
    * Varies each Swago. Some are all nCraves, others are all Shopping, and
      some are a mix of all sorts of stuff.
    * Submit a pattern for more SB/s. Most Swago boards have a paid thing
      in the middle so you likely won't get a full board unless you want to pay
      more than the board is worth (if you are gonna buy it anyway, go ahead but
      just know that you aren't gonna make a profit if you do)
    * Some Swago boards also give you spins for Spin & Win for each square
      and the patterns.
 * Spin & Win
    * Spin the Wheel to earn either SBs, Swagstakes Entries, or
      Bonuses (usually Double Search Wins but there's been others like Double
      Survey SBs)
    * Swagbucks launched a daily version of Spin & Win but it was
      taken down to fix some bugs and will be coming back soon.
 * Team Challenges
    * Join the challenge and do normal tasks to earn points for a
      randomly assigned team.
    * Team that wins will get SwagUp bonuses (usually Redeem
      Discounts)
    * During the challenge, redeem all SwagCodes in SwagButton or
      App as codes redeemed on the website don't count get your team points

# SwagCodes
SwagCodes are easy points if you get them in time! They usually are 1-5 SB and
only require typing the code in the SwagCode redeem box at the top of every
page, the SwagButton extension, or the App.

http://sbcodez.com and the Swagbucks Subreddit posts them as soon as they come
out and they have ways to get SMS/Push notifications of new codes.

Swagbucks has multiple different code types:

 * Regular Codes
    * The normal ones, enter them in any SwagCode box (Web, Mobile,
      Extension)
    * Sometimes other countries codes work for US and vice versa.
      Check them to make sure.
 * Stealth Codes
    * Similar to regular codes but have random stuff at the end
      that is unique for each user.
    * Example: `StealthXXXXX` where `XXXXX` is different for each user.
 * Mobile Mondays
    * Every Monday, codes can only be redeemed in the Swagbucks
      Mobile app.
    * US only, other countries get regular codes.
 * SwagButton Thursdays
    * Every Thursday, codes can only be redeemed in the
      SwagButton extension for Chrome and Firefox.
    * Disable the extension the rest of the time as it takes
      lots of memory usage and could lag your computer.
 * iSpy Tuesdays
    * They release 4 questions as clues and you use SB Search to
      find the answer.
    * Only good for a few thousand people so be fast!
 * Swag Code Extravaganza
    * Every so often, Swagbucks will have a day where they
      release many codes instead of just one. These are usually regular codes
      but sometimes also include Stealth ones.
