Time for more updates! This one focuses a bit less on the website for once and
more on other various projects!

Steem
I'm now on this blogging platform called Steem [https://steem.io]  which you get
paid to post. If that sounds familar, you might remember multiple platforms in
the past that promised the same (Tsu, Rabadaba, etc.) but this one is quite a
bit different!

Unlike those, Steem is not only a blog but a full blown platform consisting of
their own Crypto Currency (think Bitcoin), a blockchain (also like Bitcoin,
allows everything to be verifible and distributed), and multiple apps (some
official and some unofficial) based on said Blockchain and currency:

 * Steemit [https://steemit.com]: The main app, a blog platform kinda like
   Medium where you publish articles to topic channels instead of managing your
   own site.
 * DTube [https://dtube.video]: A decentralized YouTube-clone powered by Steem
   and IPFS.
 * Busy [https://busy.org]: Alternate UI that's more like a social network.
 * ChainBB [https://beta.chainbb.com]: Another Alternate UI but this one is more
   like a Forum.
 * Streemian [https://streemian.com]: Provides various services to enhance your
   experience like Cross-Posting

And that's only a small few!

Speaking of Streemian and Cross-Posting, this post is an example of that! You
can see it both on my website
[https://brandongiesing.com/2017/08/27/updates-stuff/]  and on Steemit
[https://steemit.com/life/@brandongiesing/here-comes-the-steem-train-or-updates-and-stuff-5]
!

Check me out on Steem! [https://steemit.com/@brandongiesing]

CosiCast
CosiCast recently celebrated it's 2 Year Anniversary! Thanks everyone for all
the support over the past two years, if you haven't seen the 2 year video it's
embedded below.

DTube
Also I mentioned DTube above, I'm now using it in addition to YouTube and Vidme
for CosiCast! So far it's working pretty great and I even got to help out the
creator of DTube, @heimindanger, with a Linux Bash Script for the upcoming
update. (Will edit with his announcement when it goes live tomorrow)

Thanks again for all the support and I'll see you guys next time!
