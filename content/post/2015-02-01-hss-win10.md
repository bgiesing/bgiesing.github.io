## WELCOME TO HOME SCREEN SUNDAY!

Welcome to Home Screen Sunday, a series every **Sunday** where we look at home
screens from me or even others and explain how it works. It can be Android, iOS,
or even Desktop!

## LET'S DO IT!

For today's entry, we are looking at my Windows 10 Start Menu arrangement. Not
exactly a home screen but close enough!

### REQUIREMENTS

Okay, this weeks setup is a little bit different. You will need Windows 10 to
use it and that is currently only available in a Technical Preview as of this
writing. Do I recommend that you download it just for this setup? Probably not,
but if you already have it installed or were going to the go ahead.

### SETUP

1. Right Click on the Desktop and click `Personalize`
2. Change `Window Color` to `Color 6`.
3. Arrange the tiles like the image.

### CUSTOMIZE

This setup is obivously loosely based so you can customize it how you wish.

## ENJOY

I hope that you enjoyed this installment of Home Screen Sunday (HSS)!
