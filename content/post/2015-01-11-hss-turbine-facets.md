## WELCOME TO HOME SCREEN SUNDAY!

Welcome to Home Screen Sunday, a series every **Sunday** where we look at home
screens from me or even others and explain how it works. It can be Android, iOS,
or even Desktop!

## LET'S DO IT!

First up, we have my current Android 5.0 Lollipop Home Screen on my Moto G.
