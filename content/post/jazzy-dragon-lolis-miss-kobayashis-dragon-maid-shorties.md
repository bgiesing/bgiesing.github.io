First off, I want to say sorry for the severe lack of videos! I've either been
way to busy or have no ideas when not.

I just recently started getting into this wonderful anime and you should check
it out also! Here's an edit of some of the best clips from the show so far set
to an instrumental of the show's awesome, jazzy theme song!

Also, since I have been away so long. Enjoy a new Thumbnail Style, Outro Style
and Song, and a new version of Cosi!
