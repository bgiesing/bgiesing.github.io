## An Apology

Sorry for no HSS/Home Screen Sunday post last weekend. I am sorry if you expected it and it didn't happen.

## Why?

The reason why I missed it is because my dad was in the hospital on the Friday before and we all thought he had a heart attack but in reality, he had some really bad indigestion from Chili. Stupidest reason ever, right? However it made our life a little bit of a mess over that weekend.

## Why not do it later?

Then it wouldn't be Home Screen **Sunday**!

## Thanks

I hope you understood and I hope to have on this weekend and *maybe* another post!
