I'm a Chrome Die-Hard, but today I am trying out Firefox with Tree Style Tabs. This may make me switch!

![Firefox with Addons](https://i.imgur.com/HS4ykf8.png)

## What is Tree Style Tabs?

[Tree Style Tabs][1] moves the Tabs to a sidebar and they are organized like a
folder.

It allows better productivity!

## Other Addons

I also have some other addons installed including:

- [AdBlock Plus][2]: I use this mostly for annoying sites but I let though some!
- [HTTPS Everywhere][3]: This is a must-have privacy tool!
- [DuckDuckGo Plus][4]: Makes DuckDuckGo Better and even if you use Google, it
  will spruce it up with DDG's answers.
- [Tab Mix Plus][5]: Enhance's Firefox and is compatiable with Tree Style Tabs!
- [Lazarus][6]: Make sure you don't loose forms due to crashes!
- [Session Manager][7]: Save tabs (and Tree Style Tab's Tree Structure) across
  sessions!
- [Download Manager (S3)][8]: Get rid of the Download Window and move it to a
  bar at the bottom like Chrome
- [FT DeepDark Theme][9]: Awesome Dark Theme

## Where is the Title Bar?

Also, you may notice that I don't have a Title bar.

This is because a Linux distro I just installed called [Manjaro Cup of Linux
Edition (or mCOLe)][10] with the Borderless option enabled This looks cleaner
and cooler when maximized and allows better window tiling!
