Another week and more updates! This week's focus is doing more of various
things.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Support Me Page Updated!
If you love what I do, it would be really nice if you helped me to make more!
That's why I have a page with ways you guys can help me continue to do what I
do. A lot of the options don't even require you to have to spend money to do it.

I currently have many different kind of ways to help me on my support page:

 1. Direct Cash

 * Things like getting donations via PayPal, Cryptocurrencies, or
   tips/subscriptions on Vidme
 * I get cash directly and then buy anything I want to focus on with it)

 2. Commissions

 * When you buy stuff on my Store page, click the ads on the site, or view
   Shorte.st [http://Shorte.st]  links.
 * Also includes Money Routine Referral Links

 3. Merch/Products

 * Physical items you can buy I made like my Bandcamp music, RedBubble
   stickers/shirts/mugs/etc, and my Wallpaper Collection.

 4. Gifts

 * All of the above give me money to spend on stuff but you also can just buy
   the stuff directly.
 * My Amazon Wishlist is the big example here. You buy the stuff with your
   Amazon account and it gets shipped to me.

 5. Feedback/"Spread the Word"

 * Lastly, if you have no money you can always just let me know how to improve
   and tell others to check out my stuff.

I've added some new things and updated the layout of everything!

New Methods: Site Fund Donations and more Crypto!
Today's first new method is a "Gifts" one. Do you like what I do explicitly on
this site and would hate to see the site disappear? (things like my Money
Routine) Well thanks to the new host I switched to in the first Updates & Stuff
post, NearlyFreeSpeech, you can!

Simply go to my Contributions page on their site
[https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/contribute/www.brandongiesing.com]  and you
can add directly to the site's funds to prevent it from going offline! They
accept Credit/Debit Cards, PayPal, Dwolla, Bitcoin, and even physical checks if
you mail it to them!

The site is paid daily via usage and currently only costs a couple bucks a month
so even if you can only donate $5, that's still about 3 months of extra time the
site can stay up! This is a great way to support the site with not a lot of
money.

The second method is about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. I previously had a
button on the page that showed my Bitcoin address so you could send me some.
Times have changed though since I added that when it was originally hosted on my
Tumblr! Bitcoin prices are now almost at $3K and many other coins have also
become popular like Ether and Monero.

To allow more coins, I've swapped the CoinWidget button with a ShapeShift Shifty
Button! This will open in a new window and allow you to send me basically any
altcoin you have (they support basically all) and it will get converted and
deposited into my Bitcoin wallet!

Layout Updates: Contributors Page and More!
In addition to new ways to support me, I'm now gonna start recognizing people
who have helped me (when/if somebody ever does!). There's currently nobody so
the page isn't up but it will be linked in the header once somebody does!

If you want your name to be here, tell me who you are and 1 link you want
featured (your website, YouTube, a referral, etc.) For example, people who use
the new Site Fund donations I mentioned above can let me know this info in the
"Message to Site Operator" box.

As for other various changes:

 * Renamed PayPal section to Cash and also added Dwolla.
 * Various layout improvements


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Speed Updates
I did some more optimizations on images and other things to hopefully speed up
the site even more.

 * Post thumbnails have been scaled down from original sizes (4K or 1080P
   usually) to 720P as they show small anyway as is so the bigger sizes did
   nothing more but use more disk space (making the site more expensive) and
   slow down pages.
 * Compressed resources Ghost itself uses in addition to my personal stuff.
 * A lot more I'm not gonna go in depth on.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CosiCast
New Videos
I finally released a Shorties for Glitchtale Do or Die like I've been meaning to
get around to. (One on the newer episode "Love (Part 1)" is coming soon.)

Also released a Channel Trailer!

Post Updates
I forgot to make posts for some of the newer videos here so I went back to make
them and changed them to use Vid.me [http://Vid.me]  embeds since YouTube has
been having so many issues.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's it for this Updates & Stuff but stay tuned for a separate CosiCast only
Edition coming very soon since I have some BIG  changes in store for CosiCast.
So much more that it needs it's own post!
