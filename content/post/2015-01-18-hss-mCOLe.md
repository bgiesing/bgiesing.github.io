## WELCOME TO HOME SCREEN SUNDAY!

Welcome to Home Screen Sunday, a series every **Sunday** where we look at home
screens from me or even others and explain how it works. It can be Android, iOS,
or even Desktop!

## LET'S DO IT!

For today's entry, we have a simple setup by me based on [Manjaro Cup of Linux
Edition (or mCOLe)][mCOLe] with a few tweaks!

### REQUIREMENTS

For most of the stuff, you need mCOLe to have it pre-setup that way. It is
possible on other Linux Distros but will be harder to set up.

Also, you will need:

- [This Wallpaper][wall]
- [AutoKey]

    > This allows you to expand text shortcuts, optional.
- [Firefox]

    > Set it up like [this post]({% post_url 2015-01-17-firefox-tree-tabs %})!
- [Atom]

    >Text Editor by GitHub, optional.

### SETUP

1. Right click on Panel/Taskbar and click `Panel > Panel Preferences`. Then go
to `Appearance` and choose `None (Use System Style)`
2. Remove most of the Launchers/Pinned Items on the left side except Terminal,
Home, Mousepad, and Firefox. `OPTIONAL` Right click on Mousepad and change it to
Atom.
3. Go to where you downloaded the wallpaper, right click on it, and choose `Set
as wallpaper` from the context menu.
4. Click the `Start Menu`, then the `All Settings` icon in the corner. Under
`Window Manager > Style > Theme`, choose `Borderless`!
5. `OPTIONAL` Download AutoKey and setup text snippets to make writing faster.
For example, I can write lp for Lollipop and if I change the Capitalization, it
will capitalize it for me!

### CUSTOMIZE

Now that you got the basic layout, feel free to customize it!

## ENJOY

I hope that you enjoyed this installment of Home Screen Sunday (HSS)!
