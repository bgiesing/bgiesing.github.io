[http://brandongiesing.com/money/]

So today is September 21st (in Missouri/Central Time Zone) and on August 24th, I
started using "Beer Money" apps. So while it's not the end of the September for
a monthly roundup kind of post, it's the end of my first 4 weeks of money making
so I figured I would write a bit about it! My earnings, my devices, what
apps/sites, and more!

Disclaimer: I have no job because very few people want to hire an autistic teen
who has weight, sight, sleep, and knee issues. So I'm here doing this all day
and most likely make more than you would.

My Devices
So far I use 5 dedicated mobile devices, my main phone, and 2 PCs for money
making. I also bought a Google OnHub to improve my internet this past weekend
with ~$200 of birthday money.

Mobile Devices
 * Google Nexus 7 (2012)
 * Google Nexus 7 (2013)
 * Moto E (2015)
 * LG Optimus Zone 3 (first device bought for Money making)
 * BLU Energy X Plus (was main up till Monday)
 * Nextbit Robin (main device, got it Monday after winning a contest)

PCs
 * Acer Aspire Z All-in-one Desktop running Windows 10
 * TOSHIBA C55t Laptop with CloudReady (aka Chrome OS, Neverware makes it
   working with Google mostly for Schools to use it without upgrading old
   computers)

My Apps and Routine
I don't have any set schedule of what devices should be doing what at certain
times but here's the basics of what I do.

If they are linked, it's my referral link! Otherwise, just search for them.

 * Swagbucks (Web+Apps) [http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/BrandonGiesing] * Run as
      many of the Swagbucks apps as I can. Some days only SBTV and Lifestylez on
      2 devices since they often give me non-stop bonus rounds but sometimes I
      do the rest also, usually max 3 devices (The 2013 Nexus and BLU for 2, my
      Robin also if 3)
    *
      ToolbarTV/Swagbutton videos is always running on my Laptop. Since it now
      works passively, it's just always there while I'm doing other stuff.
    * Swag
      codes and Inbox videos also if I remember them or they are not expired by
      time I get to them.


 * InstaGC (Web) [https://www.instagc.com/bgiesing] * Watch section running on
      desktop 24/7 unless Playlist runs out while asleep.


 * Perk (Apps) [http://perk.fm/4utfk] * Perk TV is always running on the LG
      Optimus and Moto E 24/7. The BLU joins it overnight since Swagbucks is
      always messing up with the ads and the Nexus 7 (2012) joins after
      running...
    * AppTrailers runs on my Nexus 7 (2012)
      before turning on PTV and I convert the points to Perk. Also run though it
      on my Nextbit Robin and the BLU.
    * Use Viggle occasionally but rarely watch
      TV
    * Perk.tv [http://Perk.tv]  and Viggle.tv [http://Viggle.tv]  get used some
      but they run like crap on my computers.


 * Checkpoints (Apps) * Runs on Nexus 7 (2012) overnight because what I said
      above under Perk.
    * First check in to the one business that appears nearby
      my house and then I play all the videos.


 * S'more and SlideJoy (Apps) * Lockscreen apps that pay each time you unlock
      your screen. Only use on my main (was BLU, now Robin)


 * Microsoft Rewards [formally Bing Rewards] (Web) * Search with Bing
    * Run Microsoft Edge for the
      browse and earn
    * Complete Dashboard tasks


 * EarnHoney (Web) * Ran the videos, don't anymore as the site is really prone
      to crashing my computers.



In addition, I run use Rabadaba, Foap, and Flii.by [http://Flii.by]  which pays
for making posts. I haven't got anything yet so they aren't in the earnings
below.

I've also tried some others but either couldn't get them to work or they take
way to long. This includes Inbox Dollars, GiftHulk, and a few more.

My Earnings
So of course this is what you really want to know, right?

Also only Swagbucks has been since Day 1 so not all apps have had their full
potential yet. Bing Rewards and the Lockscreens were started before Aug. 24th
but I only started them regularly, non-stop 4 weeks ago with Swagbucks, I will
include all-time earnings for those and only this months since the others are
all all-time earnings.

With that said, here's my earnings this month:

 * Swagbucks: 6019 SB or $60.19
 * InstaGC: 1,938 Points or $19.38
 * Perk/AppTrailers/Viggle: 8,595 Perk Points or ~$8.60
 * Checkpoints: 784 points or ~$1.20
 * S'more: * All-time since May 15th, every day except 5/23-6/29 as I forgot to
      reinstall when phone got reset: 955 points or $9.55
    * This month: 270 points or $2.70


 * SlideJoy: * All time since October 2015 (can't remember exact date). Again
      every day except when I forgot to reinstall sometime between December 2015
      and March 2016: $16 (their point values have changed since I started so
      don't have points for this one)
    * This month: 2,943 SlideJoy Carats or $2.94


 * Microsoft/Bing Rewards * All time, on and off since May 2014. Everyday since
      August 24th: 15,740 Microsoft Points aka 1574 Bing Credits before the
      rebrand or ~$15 for 2 Amazon gift cards, 1 Windows Store card, and 50
      points donation to my old school.
    * This month: 7240 Microsoft Points or 1 $5 Amazon
      Gift Cards and 3240 points left to another one.



Total:  ~$100.01 (some values might be slightly off like the Microsoft Rewards
as they are harder to calculate but at least $100, possibly higher by a couple
bucks or so)

All of that is merely from what I mentioned above! No referral earnings on any
of them except InstaGC which 34.75 of the 1,938 is referrals (so not even a full
dollar as 100=$1).
