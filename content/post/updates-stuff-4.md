A lot has changed since the last post but a lot of it isn't visible so lets
discuss it!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Website Updates
## New Server
As much as I loved using NearlyFreeSpeech, there was some issues with it
involving Ghost. Ghost 1.0 just came out and now requires more stuff to install
which NearlyFreeSpeech doesn't allow being a shared host.

So to upgrade to Ghost 1.0, I've moved over to DigitalOcean
[https://m.do.co/c/48175f5b14f3]  instead. This will cost a bit more ($5/month
vs pay-per-usage which averaged $3/month) but will be better in the long run:

 1. A full private server meaning no matter what changes Ghost makes, it will
    work.
 2. I can host more stuff now if I wanted to (email, cloud storage, etc.) for my
    own use.
 3. Still cheaper than most VPS' and DO is super highly praised for their
    support and service.

## Ghost 1.0
Speaking of Ghost 1.0, this site is now running on it! I had to rebuild the
entire site from scratch and manually move stuff over so if you notice any
issues, please let me know. Currently one bug is the video posts don't display
the Vid.me [http://Vid.me]  embeds right, this is gonna be fixed soon. (Getting
the theme dev to add it natively so I don't have to redo it each theme upgrade)
With the change, everything should be faster and more stable.

## CloudFlare Apps
I've installed some CloudFlare apps to make the site a tiny bit better!

 * PACE: Adds a cool progress bar to the top of every page.
 * A Better Browser: Warns you if your browser is out of date (And may be
   incompatible with the site)
 * Reading Time: Shows you how long it will take to read a post
 * AutoLink: Automatically fixes links that were just text and links Twitter
   usernames and hashtags automatically (like @BrandonGiesing and #CosiCast)
 * Typist: Provides that cool typing animation on the homepage.

## Ads
I've replaced the LeadsLeap ads with RevenueHits cause I wasn't earning much and
added the RevenueHits toolbar at the bottom. I know these new ads aren't the
best (fake Download buttons usually) but they do earn more and at least they
aren't slow or virus filled like some others.

# Other Stuff
## CosiCast
Since the last Updates & Stuff, I released 3 new videos!

 1. A preview of what a CAST Channel Promo could look like
 2. A Shorties based on Sonic Mania (coming out in a few days, PC version in a
    few weeks!!)
 3. A Shorties on AntiSepticEye's newest hijacking.

## Social Media
I made a Telegram to send notifications about new stuff! Think of it like these
posts but in realtime instead of as a recap later on. You can join here!

Overall the site should be running way better now! If you notice any issues, let
me know. See you guys next time!
